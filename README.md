# Drone Traffic Management Project
Dynamic Traffic Management and Vehicle Track and count using Drones

## 1. Connecting to DJI Tello Drone: 
1. Place the batteries inside the drone and press the switch on button on the drone placed on the left side.
2. wait for a second untill the front LED indicator on the drone starts blinking in yellowish color. 
3. Locate the Tello Wifi Network in your Wifi List and then connect to it.

## 2. To see it in action:

1. Open Two Command prompts in the working directory (or just open cmd and then direct it to the folder using `cd` command) 
2. In the first command prompt: type `python tello-command.py` and hit enter, this will initialise the tello drone. (Your DJI tello drones must be connceted for this step. refer to [1. Connecting to DJI Tello Drone](#1-connecting-to-dji-tello-drone)).
3. Type `command` and hit enter, this will tell the drone to operate in a command prompt way.

4. after which you should see a `response: ok`.
5. after this you can tell your drone to takeoff etc, simply type `takeoff` and hit enter.
6. Type `streamon` and hit enter, this will switch on the camera stream for the next process to follow.
7. Now in the second command prompt copy and paste this command:
```python
python detect_video.py --weights ./checkpoints/yolov4-tiny-416 --size 416 --model yolov4 --video 0 --output ./data/video/output.avi --count --tiny
```

8. This will run the detect_video.py file and instruct it to use the camera stream as an input to detect the cars and then save the output in an "output.avi" file in the data/video folder.

*If you see some red color errors after running the `detect_video.py` don't worry they just occur because it takes time to listen to the video stream of the drone and until then the program can't find any frame/image to run the detection onto, it takes about 3-4 seconds in the beginning.*
